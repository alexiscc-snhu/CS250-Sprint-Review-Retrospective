## Reflection

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How do user stories help?**  
I talk with stakeholders to understand their goals and challenges. I turn those needs into user stories with clear acceptance criteria. This helps the team focus on creating features that truly meet user expectations.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes will I use going forward?**  
I work iteratively, developing and testing small parts of a program in each sprint. I use Agile practices such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, reviews, and retrospectives to stay organized, adaptable, and focused on teamwork.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
A good team member communicates clearly, supports others, and takes responsibility. Collaboration and respect are essential to building quality software and ensuring the whole team succeeds.
